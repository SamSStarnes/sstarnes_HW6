            After trading away one of my favorite players to watch in recent memory in Justin Fields, now it is the Caleb Williams era in Chicago, and until we inevitably draft him, I will be going back to

              this site</a> until draft day.
            Hopefully this leads to my Chicago Bears having a franchise quarterback for the first time ever. There is a saying that goes, "It's the hope that kills" and this is the most hope I have had regarding the Bears in my life, and for the life of me I hope we do not fumble (no pun intended) this opportunity we got handed to us on a silver platter.

          <h2 id="Blackhawks">Blackhawks</h2>
          <p>
            The Blackhawks are about a year ahead of the Bears in their rebuild, subbing out future Bear Caleb Williams for current Blackhawks Connor Bedard, regarded as one of the best prospects the NHL has ever seen. The Blackhawks lucked their way into the number one pick last year, and subsequently picked Bedard, who is on Pace to win the Hart Trophy, the NHL's rookie of the year award. Bedard is doing this while missing over a month for a broken jaw he suffered this season. While he is a blast to watch, the rest of team is not so easy on the eyes. The Blackhawks have already been eliminated from playoff contention for the current season and are possibly getting their second number one overall pick in as many years. This year, the big man every team wants is Macklin Celebrini, who is being talked up similiar to none other than Bedard. If the Blackhawks are able to secure another number one pick, paired with the prospect they have in their current system. The Blackhawks may be looking towards another dynasty a la the early 2010s, where the Blackhawks where the team no one wanted to play.

          <h2>Cubs</h2>
          <p>
            The Cubs are my favorite baseball team and while many people know them as the "lovable losers" they are turning the corner and will be contending for a playoff spot this season, unlike the previously mentioned Bears and Blackhawks. I would be doing a disservice if I did not mention Wrigley Field, the best baseball staidum in the country, and quite possiby the best sporting venue in America. Now we at Iowa know Wrigley hosts more than just 81 baseball games in a year, as they hosted our Iowa football team last year. While football is a higher scoring game than baseball, the ge between Iowa and Northwestern did not even reach the top 10 highest scoring games at Wrigley Field last year, a feather in the cap for both defenses, and a harsh truth for either offense. Back to the Cubs, they have resigned Cody Bellinger and fan favorite Mke Tauchmann, they are primed to compete for the Central Division, and maybe even make a run in October if they get hot.

          <h2 id="Bulls">Bulls</h2>
          <p>
            The Bulls are last of the Chicago teams in terms of how much I watch and care about the team's success. They have not doen themselves any favors as the two Bulls games I was at ended in a bad upset loss, and the largest loss in NBA playoff history. If I were talking about these teams a decade ago, I would almost certainly have the Bulls 1 or 2, as Derrick Rose is still my favorite athlete ever and he was a blast to 
            <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v0g4nyveP8 > watch</a>. Now the Bulls are contending for a playoff spot and likely won't succeed. I was not around for the Jordan era but I believe the Bulls becoming a power in the NBA would lead to a similiar fandom around the Bulls and would likely encourage me to take the Bulls more seriously. Until Jerry Reisndorf sells the team, I question the leap being made as he has said before that having a contending team rather than a champion is better for business.
