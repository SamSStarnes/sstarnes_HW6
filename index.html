          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p class="black">
            My name is Sam Starnes and welcome to my web page, I am currently a sneior at th University of Iowa and will obtain a degree in Business Analytics and Information Systems come the end of this spring semester. I will also graduate with a minor in Sport and Recreation Management, which i hope to be able to put to good use in my future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some more about me, I am from Cedar Rapids, a short 45-minute drive from the University of Iowa and I will be moving to Chicago this summer where I will start my full time job. I have always wanted to live in Chicago and a big part of this is my Chicago sports fandom, I support all Chicago pro teams apart from the White Sox, which has led to a multitude of dissapointing seasons throughout my lifetime. If you would like to read my thoughts on the teams please

            This project uses two primary sources of data: Metacritic's game
            critic and game player review scores of different games and VGChartz
            data about video game sales.
          </p>

          <h3>2.1 Review Scores</h3>
          <p>
            I collected data from Metacritic, which contained user (user score)
            and critic (meta score) review scores for each game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Metacritic's data was found on 186 different web pages. I wrote a
            web crawling script to collect all data across these 186 pages. I
            collected the game title, summary, platform, user score, meta score,
            and release date for 18,526 games. Some of the results were the same
            game that was released on different platforms, which is essential to
            consider when I begin merging the data. I created a data frame which
            is contained in the Metacritic.csv file in the project folder. The
            web crawling script that I wrote is contained in the metacritic.R
            file in the project folder.
          </p>

          <p>
            The data didn't need much cleaning; however, to make the platform
            match with the VGChartz data, I created a dictionary to convert
            Metacritic's platform data to match VGChartz. This cleaning was done
            in the file combining_vgs.R.
          </p>
          <img

              width="800"
              title="Figure 6: Total Sales by Release Date"
            />

          <h3>2.2 Video Game Sales</h3>
          <p>
            The website VGChartz provides sales data about the number of units
            of each game/platform combination sold. The information was
            contained in 1,249 web pages. Due to the extensive nature of the
            data, I decided to break the web crawling results into six different
            CSV files (VGChartz_0 - 5.csv), all contained in the project folder.
            The web crawling script is contained in the vgchartz.R file in the
            project folder. I collected the game, platform, release date,
            publisher, and sales data from PAL, Japan, and North America as well
            as total game sales for 62,398 games. Like the Metacritic data, some
            of these games were released on multiple platforms, which count as a
            unique observation in the data. Another interesting thing to note is
            that series were counted in this data frame alongside their
            individual counterparts. For example, Super Mario is counted as a
            series, but each entry in the series is also contained in the
            dataset. This was handled in the cleaning of the data. In cleaning
            the data, I merged all six VGChartz .csv files into one complete
            file using row bind to build a complete data frame. I also removed
            unnecessary columns, trimmed the white space on the title, and
            returned only the distinct values of the dataset. When I read the
            CSV into the script, I created NA values where data was missing. I
            also removed the game series by filtering them out during data
            cleaning. This cleaning was done in the file combining_vgs.R.
          </p>
          <h3>2.3 Combining Reviews and Sales</h3>
          <p>
            Since both data sets included the same game title multiple times
            based on the platform, I had to merge based on both the game title
            and platform. Both data sets are also vastly different in the number
            of observations. I decided to create two separate data sets in
            merging. One data set is the intersection of the data and only
            contains data that appears in both data sets. The other data set,
            called the union, contains all rows from both data sets. All this
            work was done in the combining_vgs.R file in the project folder.
            Next I imported both data frames into the cleaning_vgs.R file in the
            project folder for further cleaning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the differentiator between both data frames is their number of
            rows and most of my cleaning was regarding the columns, I created a
            function to iterate over both data sets to clean them. This cleaning
            included trimming the white space on the summary and publisher,
            turning the sales data into numeric, and adding the platform,
            publisher, and title as factors. I also turned all the release dates
            into a “Month, Year” format and combined the release date from
            VGChartz and Metacritic into one column. Next, I dropped all sales
            data except North America sales and total sales. I also dropped the
            extra release date column, and the index columns. I exported these
            datasets to VGSales_union.csv and VGSales_intersect.csv,
            respectively. The union had 68,288 observations, and the intersect
            had 12,288 observations. A description of each variable is contained
            in Table 1.

              Is there a strong correlation between a game's review score and
              its sales? Is the meta score or the user score a better predictor
              of a game's sales?
            </li>
            <ol>
              <li>
                There is limited correlation between review scores and sales.
                But while the correlation isn't very strong, it does appear meta
                score is a better predictor of sales than the user score.

              Have the total sales of games seen an increase over the years?

            <ol>
              <li>
                There is some correlation between release date and number of
                games released, but it is not especially strong. There was a
                peak in the number of games released around 2010 but since there
                has been a decline.

              Which publishers have had the highest sales over the past ten
              years? Is there a difference between those with high sales in
              North America and those with high total sales?
            </li>
            <ol>

                The top ten publishers are listed above in Table 3. The same ten
                publishers are present in both total sales and North American
                sales, just in a different order. Nintendo is solidly in first
                place with 1.9 billion games sold followed by Activision at
                number two with 727 million units sold. North American sales
                accounts for 40 - 60% of total sales making this region a
                significant contributor to sales success for game publishers.
              </li>

            <li>
              Is the console on which a game is released strongly correlated to
              its ratings? Specifically, are there certain video game consoles
              that have the highest average ratings of games?
            </li>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The variables needed to answer this question were not present in
                the collected data. As noted below, this question would be an
                opportunity for further work on this project.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </ol>

          <p>
            This project has several limitations, including the lack of review
            scores for games released before the mid-90s, the improper release
            dates of some games, and the lack of information about the video
            game consoles. Future work on this project could include finding
            more sources to create a more complete dataset, analyzing the
            purchase of different video game consoles to see if the spikes in
            new video game releases coincide with more people buying video game
            consoles, and analyzing whether more time in between game releases
            for a publisher really means a better game (higher sales and review
            scores).
