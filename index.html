          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p class="black">
            My name is Sam Starnes and welcome to my web page, I am currently a sneior at th University of Iowa and will obtain a degree in Business Analytics and Information Systems come the end of this spring semester. I will also graduate with a minor in Sport and Recreation Management, which i hope to be able to put to good use in my future.

            Some more about me, I am from Cedar Rapids, a short 45-minute drive from the University of Iowa and I will be moving to Chicago this summer where I will start my full time job. I have always wanted to live in Chicago and a big part of this is my Chicago sports fandom, I support all Chicago pro teams apart from the White Sox, which has led to a multitude of dissapointing seasons throughout my lifetime. If you would like to read my thoughts on the teams please

Apart from that, I am a loyal Iowa Hawkeye fan and primarily follow the football and wrestling team, as a result this past fall has been frustrating but in the comin years with the Big 10 expanding west, I am very excited to see some schools I have never seen play at Kinnick and hopefully making a couple trips out west to those beautiful stadiums.

            I have a younger brother who also attend the University of Iowa, he is a freshman currently and I believe he will be in the Tippie College Business officially this coming fall semester. It has been a cool experience being able to live with him in the same city and expericne college together, alebeit he is starting his journey and I am wrapping mine up. I do not have too many pictures of us together so I apologize for not getting a better picture of him but as we both played football and this game was a big win, it is cool to showcase this picture as I know how important football was to him.          </p>

            This past summer I lived in Chicago while completing an internship with RSM, and I will be moving back out there this summer. Living there this past summer was a blast of an experience and in the picture below are 4 of the 5 of us that lived together on our last weekend in the city before we all went our seperate ways. Living there opened my eyes as I have always lived in Iowa and Iowa City is far and away the most "urban" environment I have lived in. Compared to the 4-bedroom apartment I lived in just next to Michigan Avenue, it was a culture shock to put it lightly. We are all planning on moving back to Chicago in the next year although we will not all be living together again.

            The four of us were pretty close this summer and I worked with John's roommate at Kansas by sheer coincidence. We all had different backgrounds and jobs and being the only Analytics student of the 5 of us living together opened my eyes to what is expected of people working in analytics as well as where people woth other backgrounds tend to struggle with things I would find not as challenging.
